----------
nfq_open()
----------

Prototype:
  struct nfq_handle *nfq_open(void)

Parameters:
  None.

Returns:
  Pointer to a new queue handle or NULL on failure.

Description:
  Obtains a netfilter queue connection handle.  When you are finished with
  the handle returned by this function, you should destroy it by calling
  nfq_close().  A new netlink connection is obtained internally and
  associated with the queue connection handle returned.

---------------
nfq_open_nfnl()
---------------

Prototype:
  struct nfq_handle *nfq_open_nfnl(struct nfnl_handle *nfnlh)

Parameters:
  nfnlh Netfilter netlink connection handle obtained by calling nfnl_open()

Returns:
  Pointer to a new queue handle or NULL on failure.

Description:
  Obtains a netfilter queue connection handle using an existing netlink
  connection.  This function is used internally to implement nfq_open(),
  and should typically not be called directly.

-----------
nfq_close()
-----------

Prototype:
  int nfq_close(struct nfq_handle *h) 

Parameters:
  h   Netfilter queue connection handle obtained via call to nfq_open()

Returns:
  0 on success, non-zero on failure. (see nfnl_close() return value)

Description:
  Close connection associated with the queue connection handle and free
  associated resources.

-----------
nfq_nfnlh()
-----------

Prototype:
  struct nfnl_handle *nfq_nfnlh(struct nfq_handle *h)

Parameters:
  h   Netfilter queue connection handle obtained via call to nfq_open()

Returns:
  The netlink handle assocated with the given queue connection handle.  If
  passed an invalid handle, this function will more than likely cause a
  segfault as it performs no checks on the provided handle.

Description:
  Returns the netlink handle associated with the given queue connection
  handle.  Possibly useful if you wish to perform other netlink communication
  directly after opening a queue without opening a new netlink connection
  to do so.

--------
nfq_fd()
--------

Prototype:
  int nfq_fd(struct nfq_handle *h)

Parameters:
  h   Netfilter queue connection handle obtained via call to nfq_open()

Returns:
  A file descriptor that can be used for communication over the netlink
  connection associated with the given queue connection handle.  On failure,
  returns ??? -1 ???. (See nfnl_fd() return value)

Description:
  Returns a file descriptor for the netlink connection associated with the
  given queue connection handle.  The file descriptor can then be used for
  receiving the queued packets for processing.

  Example:

    fd = nfq_fd(h);

    while ((rv = recv(fd, buf, sizeof(buf), 0)) && rv >= 0) {
      printf("pkt received\n");
      nfq_handle_packet(h, buf, rv);
    }

-------------
nfq_bind_pf()
-------------

Prototype:

Parameters:
  h   Netfilter queue connection handle obtained via call to nfq_open()
  pf    Protocol family to bind handle to

Returns:
  ??? (See nfnl_talk() return value)

Description:

  Binds the given queue connection handle to process packets belonging to the given
  protocol family (ie. PF_INET, PF_INET6, etc).

How many applications can bind to a given PF?
Is it per-queue, or per PF only?

??? Investigate kernel code to verify NFQNL_CFG_CMD_PF_BIND ???

---------------
nfq_unbind_pf()
---------------

Prototype:
  int nfq_unbind_pf(struct nfq_handle *h, u_int16_t pf)

Parameters:
  h   Netfilter queue connection handle obtained via call to nfq_open()
  pf    Protocol family to unbind family from

Returns:
  ??? (See nfnl_talk() return value)

Description:

  Unbinds the given queue connection handle from processing packets belonging
  to the given protocol family.
??? Investigate kernel code NFQNL_CFG_CMD_PF_UNBIND ???

------------------
nfq_create_queue()
------------------

Prototype:
  struct nfq_q_handle *nfq_create_queue(struct nfq_handle *h, u_int16_t num, nfq_callback *cb, void *data)

Parameters:
  h   Netfilter queue connection handle obtained via call to nfq_open()
  num   The number of the queue to bind to
  cb    Callback function to call for each queued packet
  data  Custom data to pass to the callback function

Returns:
  A new queue handle. (Actually a pointer to a linked list entry maintained
  by the libnetfilter_queue library)  Returns NULL on failure.

Description:
  Creates a new queue handle, and returns it.  The new queue is identified by
  <num>, and the callback specified by <cb> will be called for each enqueued
  packet.  The <data> argument will be passed unchanged to the callback.  If
  a queue entry with id <num> already exists, this function will return failure
  and the existing entry is unchanged.

The nfq_callback type is defined in "libnetfilter_queue/libnetfilter_queue.h" as:

  typedef int  nfq_callback(struct nfq_q_handle *qh, struct nfgenmsg *nfmsg,
           struct nfq_data *nfad, void *data);

  Parameters:

    qh      The queue handle returned by nfq_create_queue
    nfmsg   ???
    nfq_data  Netlink packet data handle (required as parameter of many
          of the informational functions)
    data    ??? The value passed to the data parameter of nfq_create_queue

  The callback should return ???


  /* General form of address family dependent message.
   * Defined in "libnfnetlink/linux_libnfnetlink.h"
   */
  struct nfgenmsg {
    u_int8_t  nfgen_family;   /* AF_xxx */
    u_int8_t  version;      /* nfnetlink version */
    u_int16_t res_id;     /* resource id */
  } __attribute__ ((packed));


??? How many queues can exist?
  - Could be unlimited.  Library implements as linked list.

??? Can multiple apps bind to the same queue?
  - looks like it's per app on lib side
  - ...need to check out kernel side implementation...

??? Can separate queues be processed separately by separate apps?

??? Investigate kernel code NFQNL_CFG_CMD_BIND ???

-------------------
nfq_destroy_queue()
-------------------

Prototype:
  int nfq_destroy_queue(struct nfq_q_handle *qh)

Parameters:
  qh    Netfilter queue handle obtained by call to nfq_create_queue().

Returns:
  0 on success, non-zero on failure.  (See NFQNL_CFG_CMD_UNBIND return value)

Description:
  Removes the binding for the specified queue handle.  (The queue handles are
  maintained in the libnetfilter_queue library as a linked list.  The <qh>
  is actually just a pointer to an entry in that list.  When unbinding,
  a NFQNL_CFG_CMD_UNBIND message is sent to netlink, and if successful, the
  handle entry is removed from the linked list)

??? Investigate kernel code NFQNL_CFG_CMD_UNBIND ???

  queue.  Packets can be read from the queue using nfq_fd() and recv().  See
  example code for nfq_fd().
