iptables.fpc
============

The following library is a Pascal binding and dynamic linking of netfilter's 
User Space.

Some FAQ:
=========

What is netfilter ?
-------------------
netfilter is an open source (GPL) implementation of an OSI layer 3 statful 
firewall for the Linux Kernel.

netfilter arrive with command lines tools known by the name iptables.

What does this library does ?
-----------------------------
The library provide a low level "translation" of the C headers arrive with
netfilter's User Space library to write extensions or code that can control
netfilter. 

Why do you provide LGPL code ?
------------------------------
I wish to allow others to use the translated code commercially, but GPL does not
allow to do so without releasing the source code. 
LGPL allow to us to work with GPL, because the binding code is open source and
match the GPL criteria, but the dynamic lining with LGPL does not require you to
release back your source code, unless you change the LGPL code itself.
